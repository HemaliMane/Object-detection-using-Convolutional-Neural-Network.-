# Object-detection-using-Convolutional-Neural-Network.
Food image detection is one of the most promising applications of visual object
recognition, since it will help to estimate food calories and improve people's eating habits for
health-care. The food we eat gives our bodies that "information" and “materials” they need to
function properly. If we don't get the right information and material our metabolic processes
suffer and our health declines. And when we get too much food, or the food that gives our bodies
the wrong instructions, we can become overweight, undernourished, and at risk for the
development of diseases and conditions, such as diabetes, arthritis and heart disease. In short,
what we eat is totally central to our health. Food acts as a medicine to prevent, maintain, and
treat disease. Researchers now believe that these problems are partly related to the diet. While
they used to believe that diseases-such as diabetes, obesity, heart disease, stroke, and certain
cancers were caused by a single gene mutation, they are now generally attributing these
conditions to a network of biological dysfunction. And the food we eat is an important factor in
that dysfunction, because our diets lack the necessary balance of nutrients. The project aim is to

develop an application for estimating food calories and improve people's eating habits for health-
care. Accurate methods are used to measure food and energy intakes are crucial for the battle

against obesity. It provides the users, patients with the convenient and intelligent solutions that
helps them to measure their food intake and collect dietary information are the most valuable
insights toward long-term prevention and successful treatment programs and it can be also used
in agricultural sector, supermarket. In order to identify the food objects accurately in the system,
we uses deep convolutional neural networks to classify high-resolution food images for system
training and food image recognition as one of the promising applications of visual object
recognition.
